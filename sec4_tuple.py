# We can create tuples with two different ways:
my_tuple = tuple()
my_tuple = ()

# Random tuple
random1 = ('Micheal', 10, True)
random2 = ('John', 20, False)
list = [random1,random2]
print(list)
# print(random)

string = 'Michael'
# We can get item from tuple by index referencing the item index
# print(random[0])

# We can check if item is in tuple using in operator
if 'Micheal' in random1:
    pass
    # print('Micheal is in the tuple')

# Tuple versus number in parentheses
# this is tuple
('hello',)

# this is not tuple
(9)

# We can not change tuple once it is created
# random[0] = 'John'
